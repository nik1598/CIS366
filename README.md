Introduction to .Net Development with C#

Created an application which when launched, prompts the user to enter the basic details like how many times the user wants to play before the game is over and the highest number upto which the user wants to calculate.

We added cool image pop ups upon right and wrong answers and a congratulation message once the game is over.

Try it!!
